# Change History


## TODO list
### News 
Create some ideas for theme based news maps. 
Think over how to add the current time to the prompt and take it into account when adding news to the database. This should add to the LLM the concept of the relevance of a particular event.
 
### Music 
Add progress bar when music library updating.  
Add icon change on play button when song is paused.    
Add music control to the common page header.  
Display music structure in a way as it is stored in the folders.
Add a way to change rest of metadata of the song.
Add volume control.
Remove audio elements from base.html and add them to music.html
When updating the page, it should load current radio session list and allow user to click at any song to play it.
Add button that allows to start or continue radio session.
Make music list inside its own window to not affect the top of the page.

### Fine-tuning 
Make the progress bar active when the model is fine-tuned.  
Add a way to set "Number of training epochs‚Äù, "Maximum token size" and "OpenAssistant dataset percent used" before starting fine-tuning.  
Disable the start button if fine-tuning has already started.  
Implement "self-aware" fine tuning mode to make it possible to chat with the project about itself.

### Search
Draft some ideas of how it can automatically search for lyrics of the music and add them to the music files after the user approval.

### Wiki
Display current wiki structure.
Display current active wiki page similarly to how the main page is presented.

### LLM engine
Add an ability to send text to the front-end token by token.

### General
Add an ability to load out models from the GPU by pressing the button.  
Move to single page architecture or find any other way to store the current state of the media player. Possibly using vue.js. 
Add some sort of a control panel that is active on all pages (may be hidden) and shows current GPU memory load by the system and console output. 
Add some way of displaying active page at the head menu.
Replace all "georgesung/llama2_7b_chat_uncensored" instances with info from config.yaml.
Find some way of adding some sort of "extensions" where we can see data from some arbitrary service such as twitter, youtube, reddit and so on and rates this data locally.
Create an extension that provides recent Arxiv papers (https://arxiv.org/list/cs.LG/recent).
