# Change History


## TODO list
### News 
Create some ideas for theme based news maps. 
Think over how to add the current time to the prompt and take it into account when adding news to the database. This should add to the LLM the concept of the relevance of a particular event.
Predict tags of the news and allow to filter the news by these tags.
 
### Music 
Add progress bar when music library updating.    
Add a way to change the rest of the metadata of the song.
Add volume control.
Add a message if there are new unindexed media files. 
Move the "edit" button to the song list element.

### Fine-tuning 
Make the progress bar active when the model is fine-tuned.  
Add a way to set "Number of training epochs‚Äù, "Maximum token size" and "OpenAssistant dataset percent used" before starting fine-tuning.  
Disable the start button if fine-tuning has already started.  
Implement "self-aware" fine tuning mode to make it possible to chat with the project about itself.

### Search
Draft some ideas of how it can automatically search for lyrics of the music and add them to the music files after the user approval.

### Wiki
Display current wiki structure.
Display current active wiki page similarly to how the main page is presented.

### LLM engine
Add an ability to send text to the front-end token by token.

### General
Add an ability to load out models from the GPU by pressing the button.  
Move to single page architecture or find any other way to store the current state of the media player. Possibly using vue.js.  
Add some sort of a control panel that is active on all pages (may be hidden) and shows current GPU memory load by the system and console output.  
Add some way of displaying an active page at the head menu.  
Replace all "georgesung/llama2_7b_chat_uncensored" instances with info from config.yaml.  
Find some way of adding some sort of "extensions" where we can see data from some arbitrary service such as twitter, youtube, reddit and so on and rates this data locally.  
Create an extension that provides recent Arxiv papers (https://arxiv.org/list/cs.LG/recent).  
Make a queue for LLM engine processing.  
Remove all dependencies on CDN services.
Move models to separate folder to avoid unexpected updates from huggingface.

## Versions History

Added "Self-aware" mode to the fine-tunning, that adds main code of the project to the LLM training data. 
Better representation of radio mode play history.  
Tabs on the music page are responsive now.
