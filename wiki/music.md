Music recommendations are based on the two scores: user scores and internal score. While the user score is static, the internal score is dependent on the act of listening. The initial internal score is always 0, it gets higher if the user listens to the whole song and gets lower if the user skips it. 

I would recommend to keep all ratings on the lower end, as all the music you have locally most likely will be preferred by you, so it will tend to have roughly the same high score. Try to keep 9 only for the best song you have and not use 10 at all until you hear something exceptionally good.
