This project philosophy is based around two stone pillars - keeping and controlling your data. This will allow you to use this data in the way that is most beneficial to your needs and your needs only.

When we align AI models we have to answer one important question "To whose values we want the model to be aligned with?". The answer that this project has as an answer - your values.

In some limit, to achieve perfect representation of your value the model will have to create some internal model of you which as effect may (with enough data) preserve your personality for future generations to explore.

The idea behind anagnorisis is to create a system (or agent?) that could work with massive amount of data on your on your behalf to filter, process, analyze it and present only important type of data in a way that is most suitable for an end user.
